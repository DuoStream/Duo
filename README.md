## Introduction
Welcome to **Duo** - your one-stop solution for easy, headless, Windows-based game streaming & multi-seating.

## What does it do?
If you've ever operated a GeForce Experience GameStream or Sunshine host, you'll be painfully aware of what this entails:
* You can't use your computer while you're streaming from it.
* Your computer must always be connected to a monitor, HDMI dongle, or an indirect display driver for the stream to function.
* Streaming to different clients at varying resolutions, refresh rates, or color spaces requires several helper tools to enable, disable, or alter monitor configurations.
* Only one person can stream from a given computer at a given time.

**Duo** does away with all of these issues by giving each user their own independent Desktop, essentially allowing multiple people to play games on a single computer at the same time without getting in each other's way.

## Base features
* One free Duo instance (in addition to the host's physical session, capped at 30Hz)
* Automatic display adjustments based on the Moonlight client's settings (on Windows 11 23H2 or newer)
* Supports multiple Steam instances
